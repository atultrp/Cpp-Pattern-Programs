# Introduction to Patterns in C++
While learning any programming language, students must practice print various patterns to understand and implement logical thinking as well as flow control knowledge of the language in a practical and more fun way. Patterns in C++ are the basic programs that are used for the basic understanding of any language. Two or three flow control loops are used to implement these programs. Normally, in pattern programs minimum of two loops are used i.e. one loop to create row and another loop to create a column. The First loop which is the outer loop represents the number of rows and the second loop is an inner loop which represents the number of columns. The basic structure of the Pattern in C++ language is given as follows:
<pre>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int z = 10;
  cout << z;

  return 0;
}</pre>
